# Unet2d
ImageSegmentation
How to use the project:the image files path is in the csv files,and when we put the image on the path,we just use the glandceilunet2dtest.py file train the model.
I train the model on the GTX1080,it take 20 hours,and i also attach the trained model in the project,you also just use the glandceilunet2dtest.py file to predict,and get the segmentation result.
